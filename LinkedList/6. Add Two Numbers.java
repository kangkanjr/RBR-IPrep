 * 
 * This function adds two numbers that are represented as linked lists.
 * Each node in the linked list represents a single digit, and the digits are stored in reverse order.
 * The function returns a new linked list representing the sum of the input numbers.
 *
 * The digits of the numbers are stored in reverse order in the linked lists.
 * The function returns a new linked list representing the sum of the input numbers.
 * The sum is also represented as a linked list in reverse order.
 *
 * The function handles carryover from one digit to the next and creates new nodes as necessary to represent the sum.
 * If there is a carryover after adding the last digits, a new node is created with the carryover value.
 *
 * The function uses a dummy head for the result list for simplicity.
 * The actual result list starts from the next node of the dummy head.
 *
 * The time complexity of the function is O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the two input linked lists.
 * The space complexity is also O(max(m, n)) because a new list is created to store the result.
 *
 * The function does not modify the input linked lists. It creates a new list for the result.
 * The function is robust and can handle input linked lists of different lengths.
 * It treats missing nodes in the shorter list as zeros.
 *
 *
 * @param l1 The first linked list representing a number.
 * @param l2 The second linked list representing a number.
 * @return A new linked list representing the sum of the numbers represented by l1 and l2.
